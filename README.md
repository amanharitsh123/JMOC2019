Scipt should be able to detect the distro on which it is running and should be able to run the appropriate commands to update packages. 
### 3) Running in system monitoring mode
Script should support running in a monitoring mode where it can keep a check on system health by monitoring system wide resource usage, hardware health, Network usage etc.
### 4) Mounting and Unmounting plugged in devices
